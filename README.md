Visualizing Data with Leaflet

Using earthquake data from USGS (United States Geological Survey), I create a visualization with JavaScript and HTML. 

For this demonstration, I visualize the magnitude of all earthquakes from the past 7 days (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson). Using Leaflet, I create a map that plots all of the earthquakes from this dataset based on their longitude and latitude (See "Earthquakes"). 

The second dataset on my map illustrates the relationship between tectonic plates (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json) and seismic activity (See "Fault Lines").

Using mapbox.com, I also include the following tile layers to provide different views: Satellite, Grayscale, and Outdoors. The visualization can be seen at https://nnorman312.github.io/Leaflet/index.html.
