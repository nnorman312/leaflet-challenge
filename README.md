Visualizing Data with Leaflet

Using earthquake data from USGS (United States Geological Survey), I create a visualization with JavaScript and HTML. The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. 

For this demonstration, I visualize the magnitude of all earthquakes from the past 7 days. Using Leaflet, I create a map that plots all of the earthquakes from this dataset based on their longitude and latitude. 

The second dataset on my map illustrates the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
